</ul>

<!-- What I like about this is the overlap with our design/ venture models: The questions are similarâ€¦. ex: What is the problem / opportunity? What data to collect? What means to collect (survey / imagery) etc? What is the resulting map project / service? How is it shared with community and other stakeholders? What resources are needed for each stage? -->
<h2>Life Cycle of Mapping Project</h2>
<ul>
<li>explain during and after, offer resources</li>
<li>Identification of Need</li>
<li>Definition of Kind of Features/Data to Collect</li>
<li>Data Collection / Digitization & QA</li>
<li>Production of Maps or Services</li>
<li>Sharing / Use</li>
</ul>
