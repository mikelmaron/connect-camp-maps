## Goals

* Introduction to concepts and approaches of Community Mapping in OpenStreetMap
* Hands on experience with OSM
* Generation of project ideas for community mapping back home
* Enough familiarity to spark desire to learn and develop more
* Connections to MapGive for support

## Key Ideas and Questions

* What is OpenStreetMap?

* Why not Google Maps?
* What about collision?
* How accurate is OSM? How are conflicts handled?

<!-- What I like about this is the overlap with our design/ venture models: The questions are similarâ€¦. ex: What is the problem / opportunity? What data to collect? What means to collect (survey / imagery) etc? What is the resulting map project / service? How is it shared with community and other stakeholders? What resources are needed for each stage? -->

## Life Cycle of Mapping Project

* Identification of Need
* Definition of Kind of Features/Data to Collect
* Data Collection / Digitization & Quality Assurance
* Production of Maps or Services
* Sharing / Use
