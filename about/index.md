* Hands on experience with OSM
* Generation of application ideas for community mapping back home
* Enough familiarity to want to learn and develop more
* Connections to MapGive for support

## Key Ideas

* add more resources, opencities, why not google maps (link to wb statement) open schools kenya
* why not google maps
* what about collissions
* how is accurate / conflicts

<!-- What I like about this is the overlap with our design/ venture models: The questions are similarâ€¦. ex: What is the problem / opportunity? What data to collect? What means to collect (survey / imagery) etc? What is the resulting map project / service? How is it shared with community and other stakeholders? What resources are needed for each stage? -->

## Life Cycle of Mapping Project

* explain during and after, offer resources
* Identification of Need
* Definition of Kind of Features/Data to Collect
* Data Collection / Digitization & QA
* Production of Maps or Services
* Sharing / Use
