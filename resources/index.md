## Getting Started

Prior to the event, do some basic introduction and sharing of resources, and open discussion. 

<!-- This may be most easily organized by setting up a quick website, which could be done by MapGive team. (Is there a ConnectCamp website? No, but there are two sites we can embed info on: yali.state.gov and an internal site for MWF alumni (off of the alumni.state.gov site)) -->

### Share materials

Share website, tutorials, any other information appropriate prior to event.

### Registration

Have everyone register for an OSM account. It takes just a few minutes, but better to get this out of the way beforehand if possible.

### Walkthrough on iD

The OpenStreetMap editor is called “iD”. The first time you use it, it will invite to take a “walk through” tutorial of the process.

### Start talking

If there is a mailing list or group, start socializing mapping ideas and connecting with each other.

## Resources

### In Person

Prior to ConnectCamp, we may be able to find folks from the local OpenStreetMap, to share the process directly with facilitators. We could also arrange to do this via Hangout.

### MapGive

This is the best place to start to understand the why and how of mapping.

### LearnOSM

The best self-learning guide to OpenStreetMap.

### TeachOSM

A new, and growing, set of resources for educators to bring OSM into the classroom.

### OSMGeoWeek

MapGive helped coordinate OSMGeoWeek in November. This featured 33 events across the globe, introducing OSM and working on a variety of projects. We developed an event planning guide, which has some helpful logistical tips.

### OpenCities Guide

The OpenCities Project is organized by the World Bank GFDRR. They incorporate OpenStreetMap into efforts to address disaster resilience.

### Case Studies

These case studies illustrate several examples of how OSM has been put to use in community mapping.

* [MapGive Stories](http://mapgive.state.gov/stories/)

* [Interactive Community Mapping, Between Empowerment and Effectiveness](http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/document/interactive-community-mapping-between-empowerment-and-effectiveness)

## Post Event Support

We can potentially offer several kinds of post-event support.

### Google Hangout

Schedule  Google Hangouts between fellows and MapGive. Based on interest, we can present technical or programmatic concepts. Or simple Q/A

### Individual Mentorship

For fellows seriously interested to pursue projects, set up mentorship relationship for MapGive to help in project development and technical issues.

### Imagery

If imagery is lacking in their project area, arrange for imagery through MapGive.

### Stats and Visualizations

Analysis products of community mapping projects.

### Website

If useful, continue to update website with YALI community mapping developments.
