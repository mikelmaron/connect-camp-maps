## Getting Started

Welcome to Community Mapping! Here are some first steps to get started before the ConnectCamp.

<!-- This may be most easily organized by setting up a quick website, which could be done by MapGive team. (Is there a ConnectCamp website? No, but there are two sites we can embed info on: yali.state.gov and an internal site for MWF alumni (off of the alumni.state.gov site)) -->

### Start Learning

Read and watch introductions on the MapGive Website.

* [Why Map?](http://mapgive.state.gov/why-map/)
* [Learn to Map](http://mapgive.state.gov/learn-to-map/)

### Register for an OpenStreetMap account

If there's one thing you do before the Camp, register for an OpenStreetMap account. It takes just a few minutes.

* [Sign Up](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new)

Detailed instructions on registration in part 1 of "Learn to Map".

### Walkthrough the iD editor

The OpenStreetMap editor is called “iD”. On OpenStreetMap.org, search for your home town, and zoom in. Click "Edit". The iD editor will take you through a tutorial.

More on this first step at [OpenStreetMap Welcome](https://www.openstreetmap.org/welcome)

### Read More!

There are many more resources on this page, Case Studies and Guides. Dig in!

## Resources

<!--
### In Person

Prior to ConnectCamp, we may be able to find folks from the local OpenStreetMap, to share the process directly with facilitators. We could also arrange to do this via Hangout.
-->

### MapGive

This is the best place to start to understand the why and how of mapping.

### Geospatial Revolution Video on Map Kibera

A video piece on [Map Kibera](http://mapkibera.org/). Map Kibera works with OpenStreetMap in the Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya. This video shows the process in detail in the community.

### LearnOSM

The best, comprehensive, self-learning guide to OpenStreetMap is LearnOSM.

[LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/)

### TeachOSM

TeachOSM is new, and growing, set of resources for educators to bring OSM into the classroom.

[TeachOSM](http://teachosm.org/en/)

### OSMGeoWeek

MapGive helped coordinate OSMGeoWeek in November. This featured 33 events across the globe, introducing OSM and working on a variety of projects. We developed an event planning guide, which has some helpful logistical tips.

### OpenCities Guide

The OpenCities Project is organized by the World Bank GFDRR. They incorporate OpenStreetMap into efforts to address disaster resilience. The OpenCities Guide goes into great depth on setting up a project using OSM.

### Case Studies

These case studies illustrate several examples of how OSM has been put to use in community mapping.

* [MapGive Stories](http://mapgive.state.gov/stories/)

* [Interactive Community Mapping, Between Empowerment and Effectiveness](http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/document/interactive-community-mapping-between-empowerment-and-effectiveness)

* [HOT Indonesia Case Study](http://hot.openstreetmap.org/updates/2012-07-31_indonesian_project_report_get_it_while_its_hot)

* [How Slum Communities Came Together to Help Prevent Election Violence](http://www.mapkibera.org/blog/2013/03/21/how-slum-communities-came-together-to-help-prevent-election-violence/)

## Post Event Support

MapGive will provide several kinds of support after ConnectCamp.

### Webinars

We can schedule Google Hangouts between YALI Mendela Fellows and MapGive. Based on interest, we can present technical or programmatic concepts, or simple Q/A.

### Individual Mentorship

For fellows seriously interested to pursue projects, we can set up mentorship relationship for MapGive to help in project development and technical issues.

### Imagery

If satellite imagery is lacking in a project area, additional imagery can be arranged through MapGive.

Learn more about [Imagery to the Crowd](http://mapgive.state.gov/ittc/)

### Statistics and Visualizations

MapGive can build analysis/visualization products of community mapping projects.

### Website

This website can update with developments from YALI community mapping projects.
